# Assets Directory

This directory is for storing static assets like images.

## Profile Photo
To add your profile photo:
1. Place your profile image in this directory
2. Name it 'profile.jpg' (or update the src in About.jsx component)
3. Recommended size: 500x500px or larger (square image works best)

## Project Images (Optional)
You can also add project screenshots here and reference them in the Projects component.
